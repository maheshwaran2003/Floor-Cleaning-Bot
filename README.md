  Floor Cleaning Bot is a mini project done under the Robotics Club of CEG. The main motive in doing this project is that it can assisst people in cleaning floor. 
  Arduino Uno is the micro controller used to control the bot movement. We built the entire bot on a wooden chasis.
  This one is controlled from a phone app via bluetooth module(HS- 05) but here I have also added autonomous control. 
  We used 3 ultrasonic sensors- one looks at the front, one looks left and one looks right. A latching switch is used to switch between Autonomous and Manual Mode. 
  The castor roller wheel is used to have proper movement. 
  A single fixed mop is used at front side and 2 wheels are used at back side which are rotated using a 250rpm motor. The direction of rotation of wheels are controlled using a L293D Motor Driver Board.
  We also used 12V lithium-ion batteries instead of a bulky lead acid battery which gives us more capacity and smaller size. 
  We can also control the flow of water for which I used glucose drip infusion mechanism along with 12V water pump which is connected to relay.
