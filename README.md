  Floor Cleaning Bot is a mini project done under the Robotics Club of CEG. The main motive in doing this project is that it can assisst people in cleaning floor. 
  This one is controlled from a phone app via bluetooth but here I have also added autonomous control. 
  I used 3 ultrasonic sensors- one looks at the front, one looks left and one looks right. A latching switch is used to switch between Autonomous and Manual Mode. 
  The castor roller wheel is used to have proper movement. 
  A single fixed mop is used at front side and 2 wheels are used at back side which are rotated using a 250rpm motor. Apart from that I also added an LCD display for displaying commands. 
  I also used 12V lithium-ion batteries instead of a bulky lead acid battery which gives us more capacity and smaller size. 
  We can also control the flow of water for which I used glucose drip infusion mechanism along with 12V water pump which is connected to relay.
